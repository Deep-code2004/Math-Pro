n = 10 
a , b = 0,1

print("Fibonacci sequence:")
for i in range(n): # Loop to generate n terms
    print(a) # Print the current term
    a, b = b , a + b # Update a and b to the next two terms
# This program prints the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.
# Fibonacci sequence is a series where the next term is the sum of the previous two terms.
# The sequence starts with 0 and 1.
# For example, the first 10 terms are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.
# You can change the value of n to print more or fewer terms in the sequence.
# This implementation uses a simple loop to generate the sequence.
# Each iteration updates the values of a and b to the next two terms in the sequence.
# The program prints each term of the sequence on a new line.
# Feel free to modify the code to explore different aspects of the Fibonacci sequence!
# Enjoy coding!
# Happy coding!
# The Fibonacci sequence is a classic example of a recursive sequence in mathematics.
